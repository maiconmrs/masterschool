# 🚀 Spaceship Design Challenge

## Exercise Overview

We are a startup in the **aerospace industry**, and we aim to create three types of spaceships:

- **Commercial Spaceship** 🏢: Designed for space tourism and transportation.
- **Research Spaceship** 🔬: Built for scientific studies and experiments in space.
- **Exploration Spaceship** 🌌: Equipped for deep space travel and discovery.

Each team will work **independently** on one spaceship, while **one team** is responsible for designing the **base concept** of the spaceship.

## Team Roles & Communication

- Each team will **focus** on their assigned spaceship type.
- One **team lead** will be chosen from each team.
- Team leads will **communicate with each other every 10 minutes** to ensure consistency and integration.

## Goal

At the end of the session, all spaceship designs **should match together and work** as a cohesive system.

🚀 **Good luck, engineers!** 🛠️
