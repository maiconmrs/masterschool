# 🌍 Alien Species Classification Challenge

## **Exercise Overview**  
A team of **intergalactic researchers** is working to **classify alien species** from different planets. The species can be broadly categorized into three types:

- **Terrestrial Species** 🌿: These species live on solid ground and thrive in stable atmospheric conditions.  
- **Aquatic Species** 🌊: These species are adapted to life underwater and can breathe through gills or other specialized organs.  
- **Aerial Species** ☁️: These species are capable of flying and may have wings or other adaptations for life in the skies.  

Each research team will work **independently** on one species type, while **one team** will be responsible for designing the **base classification system** that all alien species will inherit from.

---

## **Team Roles & Communication**  
- Each team will **focus** on their assigned alien species category.  
- One **team lead** will be chosen from each team.  
- Every **10 minutes**, team leads will communicate with each other to ensure a **consistent classification system** is maintained.  

---

## **Goal**  
At the end of the session, all alien species classifications **should be compatible and work as a cohesive system**, ensuring that new species can be added **without breaking the structure**.

🔬 **Good luck, xenobiologists!** 👽🛸
